# 30 Days of JavaScript (WWCode Days of Code Challenge 2024)
I am currently making my way through projects from Wesbos's [30 days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) free course. This is for my participation in the Women Who Code Frontend's #30DaysOfJavaScript track in the 2024 edition of the __Days of Code Challenge__ set up by WWCode.

### Project 1: [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/)
This allowed me refresh my knowledge of: **CSS attribute selector**, **dataset**, **transitionend** event and **animationend** event. I also learnt about the different methods available to the **<audio>** HTML element, such as **play()**, **pause()**, **currentTime**, **duration**, etc.

### Project 2: [JS/CSS Clock](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/)
This project employed ample use of the  **transform** CSS property, so I read up on all its values including: **translate**, **skew**, **rotate**, **matrix**, **scale**, and **transform-origin**. This was a good way to gain practical and theoretical knwoledge in tandem. I also refreshed my understanding of  **setInterval()** method (and how it differs from setTimeout()), as well as the **Date()** object. This project also tested my general CSS knowledge as I introduced my personal spin in an attempt to recreate the iPhone clock icon -- without the numbers though.
