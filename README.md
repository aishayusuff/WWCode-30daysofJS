# 30 Days of JavaScript (WWCode Days of Code Challenge 2024)
I am currently making my way through projects from Wesbos's [30 days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) free course. This is for my participation in the Women Who Code Frontend's #30DaysOfJavaScript track in the 2024 edition of the __Days of Code Challenge__ set up by WWCode.
