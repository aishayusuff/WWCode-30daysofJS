# 30 Days of JavaScript (WWCode Days of Code Challenge 2024)
I am currently making my way through projects from Wesbos's [30 days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) free course. This is for my participation in the Women Who Code Frontend's #30DaysOfJavaScript track in the 2024 edition of the __Days of Code Challenge__ set up by WWCode.

+ Project 1: [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/)
This allowed me refresh my knowledge of: **CSS attribute selector**, **dataset**, **transitionend** event and **animationend** event. I also learnt about the different methods available to the **<audio>** HTML element, such as **play()**, **pause()**, **currentTime**, **duration**, etc.
