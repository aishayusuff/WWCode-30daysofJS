# 30 Days of JavaScript (WWCode Days of Code Challenge 2024)
I am currently making my way through projects from Wesbos's [30 days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) free course. This is for my participation in the Women Who Code Frontend's #30DaysOfJavaScript track in the 2024 edition of the __Days of Code Challenge__ set up by WWCode.

### Project 1: [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/)
This allowed me refresh my knowledge of: **CSS attribute selector**, **dataset**, **transitionend** event and **animationend** event. I also learnt about the different methods available to the **<audio>** HTML element, such as **play()**, **pause()**, **currentTime**, **duration**, etc.

### Project 2: [JS/CSS Clock](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/)
This project employed ample use of the  **transform** CSS property, so I read up on all its values including: **translate**, **skew**, **rotate**, **matrix**, **scale**, and **transform-origin**. This was a good way to gain practical and theoretical knwoledge in tandem. I also refreshed my understanding of  **setInterval()** method (and how it differs from setTimeout()), as well as the **Date()** object. This project also tested my general CSS knowledge as I introduced my personal spin in an attempt to recreate the iPhone clock icon -- without the numbers though. 

### Project 3: [CSS Variables](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables/)
I employed one of my concepts in JavaScript (Event Delegation) to this project. This helped me optimised the event listening I had to do for the inputs. I also went further to include an input for adding a **grayscale filter**, which was a significant learning curve. I was also able to learn about the **setProperty()** method on the **documentElement**, which reminded me that I have more reading to do. 

### Project 4: [Array Cardio](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/04%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/)
This was a fun way to practice several array methods like **sort**, **reduce**, **map**, **filter**, etc. I enjoyed refrehing my knowledge of these methods and also using **console.table** to visualise results in the console, in a tabular format. I will definitely practice these array methods moving forward as this particular project helped me during a live coding interview.

### Project 5: [Flex Panel Gallery](https://aishayusuff.github.io/WWCode-30daysofJS/05%20-%20Flex%20Panel%20Gallery/)
I love how these projects are enabling me use event delegation! I employed it here as well to optimise the event listner. I also got to reapply my knowledge of transform property (using the value **translateY**). **Flex** was another property I got to refresh my knowledge of as I used it last in my vanilla JS portfolio project. I encountered a bug while trying to incorporate the **transitionend** event listner but that was because I was trying to remove the active class after adding it, like I did for the **click** event.
